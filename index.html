                <div class="longtext">
                    <p>
                        I was born in Bangladesh and currently a student at City College of New York.
                        I am expecting to graduate 2025 with a Bachelors of Engineering in Computer Engineering and a minor in Business Administration.
                        I want to continue to develop my skills as a software engineer and inevitably make impact on millions of people with my code. 
                        I enjoy putting myself in uncomfortable situations as that's when I see the most growth. 
                        On my free time, I like conversing with people, watch anime, play soccer, running, and go for walks.
                        I love working with technology, both software and hardware, as it's fascinating to see different things function together to give a certain result.
                        One of my favorite and most impactful book of all time is "Can't Hurt Me" by David Goggins.
